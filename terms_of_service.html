    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>

    <p>Please also review our <strong>Privacy Policy</strong> concerning data handling.</p>
    
    <hr />
    
    <h2>1. Nature of the Service (The "Utility" Clause)</h2>
    <p>"Net Terms Tracker" (the "Service") is strictly a data management and invoicing utility.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Not a Financial Institution:</strong> The Service is <strong>not</strong> a bank, lender, or payment processor. We do not underwrite debt, guarantee payment, or insure against default.</li>
        <li><strong>Merchant Responsibility:</strong> You (the "Merchant") are solely responsible for assessing the creditworthiness of your customers. The decision to extend "Net Terms" or credit to any buyer is made at your sole discretion and risk.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, we shall not be liable for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Non-Payment:</strong> Any failure of your customers to pay invoices generated by the Service.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Errors:</strong> Any financial loss resulting from incorrect due dates, tax calculations, or invoice totals. You agree to verify all financial data before acting on it.</li>
        <li><strong>Service Interruptions:</strong> Any inability to access invoice data during downtime or maintenance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Accuracy & Taxes</h2>
    <p>The Service calculates due dates based on the logic you define (e.g., "Net 30"). You acknowledge that the Service does not automatically remit taxes or comply with local invoicing regulations (e.g., VAT, GST) on your behalf. You remain the "Merchant of Record" for all transactions.</p>

    <h2>4. Privacy & Data Use</h2>
    <p>By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information as detailed in our Privacy Policy. Key points include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>We store order and customer details necessary to generate invoices.</li>
        <li>Data is retained for the lifetime of the app installation plus a 30-day grace period.</li>
        <li>We comply with Shopify's GDPR/CCPA data redaction requests.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Termination</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to terminate access to the Service immediately if we detect:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Use of the Service for money laundering or illegal financing.</li>
        <li>Violation of Shopify's Acceptable Use Policy (AUP).</li>
    </ul>
